# Morse code converter

> You can convert morse code to Text and Text to morse code

To convert text to morse code you should be in the same folder and where you cloned the repo 
then you can run the `main.py` file using python3.

> Generating morse sound file requires `scipy` and `numpy`. I dodn't put enough time to optimize it so I didn't add that in the main module as a selectable option.
> At the moment consumes a lot of memory to generate audio file.
